StackOverflow API Tags Browser UI

This project aims to create a user interface for browsing tags provided by the StackOverflow API. This API allows access to data related to questions, answers, and tags on the StackOverflow platform. In this project a list of tags with number of associated posts (count) is displayed. I used PrimeReact library to provide UI components.
The project has configured storybook to view components used in application.\
Technologies: React, Typescript

UI: a list of tags is diaplyed. The number of items can be controlled by input above the list. Sorting is available by clicking on column name field.
